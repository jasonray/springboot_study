### Info

origin: https://github.com/algaworks/videoaula-spring-thymeleaf-jsp with original page replaced with a [Hello World example](https://github.com/jmiguelsamper/thymeleaf3-spring-helloworld), and switched to Spring Boot and added few dependencies that may be important for jsp

### Usage
```sh
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Note

When resolvers are not configured properly, an exception
```text
javax.servlet.ServletException: Could not resolve view with name '/hello'
in servlet with name 'dispatcherServlet'
```
would be thrown in runtime - see the 
```java
@GetMapping("/misconfigured")
	public ModelAndView misconfigured()...
```
in `ThymeleafController` class. Similar error will be thrown for misconfigured JSP.


### Work In Progress

on the static `http://localhost:8080//resources/static/page.html` the app is dislaying the legacy Selenium 3.x grid console status page, to be eventually generated by thymeleaf and used for [Selenum 3.x Grid Status Checker](https://github.com/sergueik/powershell_ui_samples/tree/master/csharp/selenium3-grid-status-checker) testing
